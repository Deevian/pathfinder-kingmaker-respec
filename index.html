                    Hi! If you're here, you've already noticed that, unfortunately, Pathfinder Kingmaker does not support character respeccing.
                    In order to get around that, I've built a small, crude tool that allows you to modify your save files and manually force the respec
                    of all your characters.
                </p>
                <p>This is very experimental, so before you do anything, and for the love of god, <b><u>BACKUP YOUR SAVES!</u></b></p>
                <p>
                    Also, heads up, there's a bit of an issue that I haven't been able to fix where your main character will lose his / her appearance and will show a blank portrait on first load.
                    This should go away after save and reload, but you won't be able to see the appearance of your character during the respec. Hope you're lucky!
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...also, try not to break the tool. Because it'll probably break. Heh.
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, on with it. Here are the instructions on how to use this (this was made for Windows, so YMMV):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Store all your items (including those you have equipped) somewhere. This could could be the storage in the Capital, Oleg's second story chest, or even the floor, if you're a masochist.</p>
                        <p><b>If you do not do this, you WILL lose all your items.</b></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Save your game.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <label for="first-file">Select the save file you want to change.</label>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <input id="first-file" class="file-input first-file-input" type="file" accept=".zks"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you don't know where it is, try here:</p>
                        <pre class="file-path">%systemdrive%\users\%username%\AppData\LocalLow\Owlcat Games\Pathfinder Kingmaker\Saved Games</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a class="file-download first-download-btn" href="#">Press here to change and download your new save file</a>. Store it in the same folder as the previous one.
                        <p>
                            <label class="total-experience-label" for="total-experience">You've gained</label>
                            <input id="total-experience" class="total-experience-input" type="number" value="0"/>
                            experience points so far.
                            <br />
                            If you update the page, this value will drop back 0. You can either update it to the correct value, or start all over again.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Start your game and load the save named <u>Temp Respec</u>. Your character should have a white portrait.</li>
                    <li>Save your game again.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p><label for="second-file">Select the new save file you've created. Same place as before.</label></p>
                        <p><input id="second-file" class="file-input second-file-input" type="file" accept=".zks"/></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a class="file-download second-download-btn" href="#">Press here to change and download your final save file</a>. Store it in the same folder as before.
                    </li>
                    <li>You're done! Load the save named <u>Respec</u> and respec away!</li>
                </ol>
